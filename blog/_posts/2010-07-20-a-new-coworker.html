The shopgirl answered that, unfortunately, it was not possible to buy them. But! But, at the end of the season, in june or july, they will find new homestays for their penguins. We let our name, and voil√†, 6 months later, a new coworker in the CPPlex !
A quick poll on twitter and Facebook help us find his name : welcome Pen Pen ! Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/nmerouze">@nmerouze</a> who was the first one to suggest that name.
