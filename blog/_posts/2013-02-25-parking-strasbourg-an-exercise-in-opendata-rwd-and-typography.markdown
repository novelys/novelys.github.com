The [city of Strasbourg](http://www.strasbourg.eu) has <a href="http://www.strasbourg.eu/ma-situation/professionnel/open-data">liberated some data sets</a> a few weeks ago. This is what is called [OpenData](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data): some public entities publish some data sets under a liberal license so everybody can use them and integrate them freely in some external software.

This is how [Parking-Strasbourg.eu](http://www.parking-strasbourg.eu) was born: a little exercice in OpenData, Responsive Web Design and typography. Read more in our [case study]().
