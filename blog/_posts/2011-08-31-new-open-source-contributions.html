This pure javascript picture gallery provides you with a ready-to-use gallery, made of two components. A gallery of thumbnails, in which the user can quickly check pictures and a scrollable gallery of pictures, opened when the user touch one of the thumbnails. It works on both iOS and Android.

<strong>Android Jpeg Encoder for Titanium</strong>

By default, Titanium encodes jpeg image with the highest quality possible, sometimes resulting in heavy files sent through the network. JpegEncoder provides a small set of functions to scale, crop and compress an image. Jpeg Encoder only works on Android platforms.
