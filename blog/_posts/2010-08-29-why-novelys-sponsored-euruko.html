As the <a href="http://euruko2010.org/">Euruko 2010</a> videos are now online, <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/euruko-2010-summaries-videos-and-photos-from-europes-ruby-conference-3727.html">a resume of the event is now up on Ruby Inside</a>. With a nice quote regarding our sponsorship :


<blockquote>The organizers asked me to specially thank their biggest sponsor Novelys - a team of French Ruby on Rails experts.
</blockquote>

Just a quick note on why we sponsored Euruko. First, I have some polish blood in my veins. More seriously, we're always happy to sponsor tech events related to how we work at Novelys. We contribute open source code but we're also engaged in open source tech events. Furthermore, we heared about Applicake, Ela Madej and Paul Klipp well before Euruko and we were sure that they will do a good job organizing Euruko in the lovely city of Krakow. And we weren't disappointed ! Euruko 2010 went great and we met a lot of bright and fun people :)
