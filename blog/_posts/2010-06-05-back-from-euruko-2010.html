<p>We're back from <a href="http://euruko2010.org/">Euruko 2010</a> and we're very pleased to have sponsored this conference !</p>
<p>We went to Krakow with <a href="http://blog.strasslab.net/">Yann</a> to attend the event. And thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/PaulKlipp">Paul Klipp</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/elamadej">Ela Madej</a> and the rest of the organizing crew, Euruko 2010 was a bliss. The conference room was fully packed with Rubyist and good technical talks. Beside, you will find good overview of the 2 days conference <a href="http://nuclearsquid.com/writings/euruko-day1.html">here</a> and <a href="http://nuclearsquid.com/writings/euruko-day2.html">here</a>.<p>
<p>Bonus1 : Krakow is really a lovely city.</p>
<p>Bonus2: we even had a chance to take a photo with Matz, the creator of the Ruby language !</p>
