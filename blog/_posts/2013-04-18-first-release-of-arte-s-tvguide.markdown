For a few weeks now, we've been working for [ARTE](http://www.arte.tv) (the french-german cultural TV channel) on their new [TV Guide](http://www.arte.tv/guide/) and especially the [ARTE+7](http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/plus7) module. As the name indicates, this module is a mashup between the TV Guide and the ARTE+7 video catchup service.

Of course, the site is completely "responsive" so you can use it with your smartphone, your tablet or your regular desktop browser.

See below a few screenshots of the service :
