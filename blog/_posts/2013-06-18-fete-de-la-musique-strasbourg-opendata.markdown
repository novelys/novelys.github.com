The [city of Strasbourg](http://www.strasbourg.eu) has liberated more data sets under their Open Data initiative umbrella. This time, it's about the World Music Day and the music bands locations.

The city provides an XML file written with a specific schema in mind.

Today, we're very proud to give you [fetedelamusique-strasbourg.eu](http://www.fetedelamusique-strasbourg.eu) which display the informations contained in the official XML file. You can also add your very own music band information.

Of course, as the majority of our web projects these days, the website is completely responsive so you can consult the informations while strolling during World Music Day :)
