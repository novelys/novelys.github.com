We've just open sourced a simple chat server we wrote a few months ago, <a href="https://github.com/novelys/cockatoo">Cockatoo</a>.
<br />
It's using the fantastic EventMachine (yep, we know that node.js is the new kid in town, but well...). Several "push" technique exists, but we focused on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/novelys/long-polling-with-event-machine">Long Polling</a> as it's very easy to setup, be it on the server or the client side.
