We're very happy to announce that, **Refugees**, the project we've been working on for [Method In The Madness](http://www.methodinthemadness.eu/) and [ARTE](http://www.arte.tv)ï»¿ is now public! [Refugees](http://refugees.arte.tv/) is a "News Game" (a kind of Serious Game) where you can embody a news reporter visiting refugee camps.

While the real meat, the game part, has been developped and thought by our friends at MiTM, we took the Ruby on Rails, Back End and Front End optimizations part. You can play the game here : [http://refugees.arte.tv](http://refugees.arte.tv). This news game is part of a larger topic at Arte and you can find more informations here [http://info.arte.tv/en/refugees](http://info.arte.tv/en/refugees).
