A few months ago, Yann built <a href="http://www.monprochainbus.eu">MonProchainBus.eu</a>, which allowed people living in or near Strasbourg
to find the nearest bus/tram stops and the next three arrivals.

Ever since, I thought it would be nice to have a native counterpart on my phone, so a few weeks ago I finally gave it a go, and used the occasion to experiment with RubyMotion, a tookit for building iOS apps in Ruby.

After a few hours of work scattered over the weeks, the app is finally [live on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ye/app/mon-prochain-bus-a-strasbourg/id840790152?mt=8) and available for everyone. It focuses on one thing only at the moment: showing you the closest stations to you and the next arrivals. No directions, no custom address lookup: those will come, though. One step at a time :)

For the most part, I enjoyed using RubyMotion. I find it more elegant than Objective-C and the command-line workflow feels more natural to me than doing everything through Xcode. I can't (yet!) vouch for its use in large-scale applications, but when it comes to experiments, prototypes, and small/medium apps, I can't think of a reason not to go with RubyMotion.

We will keep improving both applications over time. If you live in or near Strasbourg and have ideas about how to improve the service, <a href="mailto:contact@novelys.com">get in touch with us.</a>

And if you are currently in another city that gives access to public transporations data, we would love to support it and expand beyond Strasbourg! Once again, <a href="mailto:contact@novelys.com">let us know</a>.
