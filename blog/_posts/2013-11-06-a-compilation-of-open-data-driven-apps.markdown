At [Novelys](http://www.novelys.com), we always try to be good citizens of the City. And part of our work implies working with various APIs, from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, EventBrite or some various other data providers.

That's why it was completely natural for us to play with [Open Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). We've now built several useful apps and we dedicated [a page to our Open Data experiments](/portfolio/opendata.html) in our [portfolio](/portfolio.html).
