        Together we define the milestones that the development will go through. We'll setup quickly a first online version, and we'll improve it incrementally with your feedback.

        Sustainable development

      <p>
        This means that our applications and code are sustainable through time, even after their initial development phase.
        This is our guarantee for cost effective maintenance, now and in the future.
        That's why we setup a complete production chain : test, staging, production and continuous integration environments.
