        <strong class="intro">The problem</strong>
        <p>
          The "Club des Ambassadeurs d'Alsace" (an online and offline social network sharing their interests in the Alsace region) is publishing a small ABC-book every year. The book is centered around 7 universes like innovation, gastronomy or culture. Each universe contains several articles. The goal of the book is to enlighten several unknown facts about the Alsace region. It's one of the many tools available to promote the Alsace region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course some informations were quickly outdated. That's why it was decided to develop an online version. However, the transition between a printed book and a nice website is not an easy task.
        </p>
        <strong class="intro">The solution</strong>
        <p>
          After Novelys has presented a concept prototype, we were hired to develop the complete solution. In 4 weeks, we developed a nice and complete responsive website which is easy to navigate and invite the user to explore all its pages, be it with a "regular" desktop browser, a tablet or a smartphone.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span4">
        <p>The site is completely responsive. That means the content is also viewable with a tablet or a smarphone.</p>
        <p>
          Certain User Interface (UI) elements are displayed or not, depending one the user's device type: screen resolution, screen orientation (portrait or landscape), touch enabled or not, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the website is viewable with a smartphone, performance and bandwith consumption were a standard feature from day 1.

          <a href="#" class="icon-arrow-down navigation gotoNextParagraph" title="go to next paragraph"></a>

          As always at Novelys, we also developed all the tools that the customer could use to manage all the content of his website.
