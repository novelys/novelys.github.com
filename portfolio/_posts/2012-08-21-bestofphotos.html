    <strong class="intro">The concept</strong>
    <p>
      BestOf Photos analyse your Facebook Social Graph to help you building your photos albums.
      <br/>
      With a secret algorithm which will analyse your relationships, tags, likes and comments, the service will be available to find your 5 best friends and propose you an automate special photo albums built upon <strong>your interactions</strong> with theses 5 best friends.
      <br/>
      The website is available in French and in English.
    </p>
    <strong class="intro">The problem</strong>
    <p>
      Gathering and analysing lots of data can be a tough job, mainly at scale and with the Facebook API.

    <strong class="intro">The solution</strong>
    <p>
      On the Back End, Novelys provided its knowledge of <strong>NoSQL</strong> databases (such as <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>Redis</strong>), its knowledge of fetching data through the <strong>Facebook API</strong> and analysing lots of data (sometimes called <strong>Big Data</strong>) to help bootstrap the BestOf Photos project and have an acceptable build time for each photobook.
      <br/>
      Each book is then rendered as PDF on the server and sent to the printing partner.
    </p>

      <a href="#" class="icon-arrow-up navigation gotoPreviousParagraph" title="go to previous paragraph"></a>

  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8" style="text-align:center;">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/portfolio/bestofphotos_2.png" />
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
    <p>
      On the Front End, using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong> and javascript, we help bootstrapped the main user interface, which is about flipping your newly created book, as you would do it with the real object.
      <br/>
      And yes, all the UI works on <strong>touch</strong> enabled devices, like the iPad.
