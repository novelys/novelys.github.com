        <strong class="intro">The concept</strong>
        <p>
          Novelys was hired initially to develop and maintain the <a href="http://www.ecologie-shop.com">EcologieShop</a> website. It's a <strong>complete ecommerce website</strong>, you'll find:
          <ul>
            <li>a tree of categories,</li>
            <li>products,</li>
            <li>product variants(bulbs can have 5W, 10W or 15W power, can be available with screws or sockets),</li>
            <li>packages (arrangement of several products with their own quantity),</li>
            <li>product rebates and category rebates,</li>
            <li>coupon code,</li>
            <li>Content Management System (CMS)</li>
            <li>Credit Card and Paypal payment gateway integration</li>
            <li>Full text search</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
          Of course a back office is available to fully operate the platform.
          <br/>
          Stock and delivery management is integrated into the ecommerce platform. Deliveries are ordered to an external logistic partner.
          <strong class="intro">The problem</strong>
          After 3 years and more than <strong>1M â‚¬ of turnover per year</strong>, the customer wanted to split the website into several, each with their own unique branding.
        </p>
        <strong class="intro">The solution</strong>
        <p>
          Novelys extracted the stock management into its own application, available trough a private API, doing what is called <strong>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then setup a source code infrastructure to share the common part between the satellite websites in a smart way.

          <a href="http://www.ecolodis-solaire.com">Ecolodis Solaire</a> is one of the many satellite website gravitating around the EcologieShop ecommerce platform.

          Each satellite website has its own operators who operates the site through its own back office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every content is manageable through this interface: the products, the packages, the SEO descriptions (Search Engine Optimisation), the news, the editorial sections, the highlighted products, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several CSV <strong>exports</strong> and <strong>dashboards</strong> are available to the admin users. It's the main software used by the customer and its employees to manage its business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Products feeds are built to advertise product informations to affiliate business partners like:
          <ul>
            <li>RueDuCommerce (XML)</li>
            <li>Netaffiliation (XML)</li>
            <li>Price Minister (XML)</li>
            <li>Neteven (SOAP)</li>
          </ul>

          The stock backend has its own dedicated control panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The web application is <strong>interconnected with the logistic partner</strong> (<a href="http://www.morin-logistic.com/">Moring Logistic</a>) to export and import delivery informations.
