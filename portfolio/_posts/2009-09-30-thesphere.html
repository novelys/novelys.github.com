    <strong class="intro">The concept</strong>
    <p>
      The-Sphere is a private online social network. In this case, that means once your membership has been accepted, you'll pay a monthly fee to access the network and its conciergerie.
      <br/>
      You'll find all the functionnalities commonly found in a social network:
      <ul>
        <li>a timeline,</li>
        <li>your friends,</li>
        <li>private messaging,</li>
        <li>group of users management,</li>
        <li>photos management,</li>
        <li>"people you may know",</li>
        <li>user's profile,</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>
      You'll also find some modules unique to The-Sphere:
      <ul>
        <li>a Concierge module with special services and products ordering,</li>
        <li>a membership module,</li>
        <li>a geolocator module (to know where your friends are),</li>
        <li>a travel guide tailored by The-Sphere members.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <strong class="intro">The problem</strong>
    <p>
      The-Sphere was initially developped by another provider and the customer wanted to accelerate the pace and quality of the software development.
    </p>
    <strong class="intro">The solution</strong>
    <p>
      Novelys was quick to respond to his demand by providing senior rails developpers to take over the project and add new functionnalities.

      A special back office module was developped for the admin users so they can quickly build a newsletter template.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the highlighted content is chosen by the admins among the available content on The-Sphere network, specific content is inserted for each user receiving the newsletter. User with a valid membership receives informations related to their activities on the network.
