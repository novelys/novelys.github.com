        <strong class="intro">The problem</strong>
        <p>
          <strong>Eckes-Granini</strong> came to us in 2008 while looking for a numeric sales book that was not tied to a specific platform, and which could easily be managed and updated when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sales book was to be used by their salesman, and therefore needed to be as intuitive as it could be. Aside from that, the very nature of their job made it clear they needed a solution that would work offline, since you can never be sure about having a network connectivity when traveling.
        </p>
        <strong class="intro">The solution</strong>
        <p>
          Considering their needs, we decided to build a web application. When we first started working on it, the web was not in the same shape as it is today, and the technologies that came with <strong>HTML5</strong> were not nearly as available as they are nowadays.
          <br/>
          This is why the first versions were powered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_gears">Google Gears</a>, which was back then the only reliable way to enable offline synchronisation.
          <br/>
          The application improved and matured as the web did, switching to standardized technologies such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5">HTML5 Cache manifest</a> as soon as they were available and stable enough.

          The application's interface makes heavy use of javascript too, in order to give a feeling of fluidity and responsiveness. The file explorer works in the same way the file explorer on your computer does. We sticked to a column-based interface since it was best suited to the client's file hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the top-right of the interface is the synchronisation status bar, where information about the current state of the application is displayed : how many files in total, how many are cached, and what is currently happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also set up a bookmark feature. Each salesman can drag the files he wants quick access to and drop them on the star. Clicking on the star will then reveal a dropdown menu with the bookmarked files.
        </p>
        <p>
          We kept the salesman interface pretty straightforward. There was no need to burden them with account edition page and other stuff: they come to the application, they log in, they see their files and which ones are cached.

          The backend is quite standard. It allows the administrator to manage users and documents. The document manipulation interface allows the drag-and-drop of its elements to change the hierarchy in a friendly way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Novelys also takes care of hosting the application on its platform. The documents are hosted on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> for greater performances.
