        <h1>What do we do?</h1>
        <p>
          We create websites, <strong>web applications</strong>, <strong>mobile web</strong> applications and native mobile applications. We can do it remotely in our office in Strasbourg, France, or we can do it on site, in your office.
          <br/>
          For <strong>7 years</strong> now, we've been helping startups, web entrepreneurs, SMEs and communities by resolving their needs on the web.
          <br/>
          Our mission is to bring ideas alive on the web as quickly as possible in order to maximise the ratio of money spent against informations learnt from users or customers.
        </p>
        <h1>Why work with us?</h1>
        <p>
          It isn’t just about developing software! Lots of people can write great code; Novelys offer more. When it comes to bridging the gap between an idea and a working project, we really know who to listen to - <strong>you</strong>! We work a lot with startups, we understand that the customer can change his mind and we adapt to it. This is the kind of competence and mindset that we can bring to any company.
          <br/>
          We are experts in our domains, and recognized as such. We now have a long <strong>track record</strong> of successul projects. We’re committed to <strong>technology</strong>. It’s a long term relationship and we’re smitten. It’s not simply a case of throwing every slice of new tech at a project. There’s a delicate <strong>balance</strong> between beneficial new technology and stable, old-faithful components. Each project is different.
          <br/>
          The web is our playing field and we're <strong>passionnated</strong> anout it. We love its plasticity, its constant organic evolution. We are always up-to-date, constantly watching new stuff, experimenting, separating the wheat from the chaff. That's why we can give you, at any moment, the best of bread answer to your project's needs. We love to say that we prefer to be at the front of the boat, feeling the fresh wind on our faces.
          <br/>
          We're <strong>Agile</strong>. Our quality process includes different agile methologies such as XP, Scrum or Kanban. Transparency is at the core of our company culture: we share our culture, our tools, our knowledge and our passion with our customers.
        </p>
        <h1>What are the technologies we use?</h1>
        <p>
          We use rapid prototyping technologies to quickly transform your ideas into a live application. Technologies such as <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="">Javascript</a> and <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="http://www.novelys.com">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> or <a href="http://www.redis.io">Redis</a> are part of our standard toolbox. We then maintain these applications through the time. We work with some customers for years now!
