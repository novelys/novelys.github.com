        <h1>What do we do?</h1>
        <p>
          We create websites, <strong>web applications</strong>, <strong>mobile web</strong> applications and native mobile applications. We can do it remotely in our office in Strasbourg, France, or we can do it on site, in your office.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>7 years</strong>, we've been helping startups, web entrepreneurs, SMEs and communities by developing software for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our speciality is to quickly transform your ideas or your specifications into a live web or mobile application, and iterate from there.

          , to maximise the ratio of money spent against informations learnt from users or customers.
        </p>
        <h1>Why work with us?</h1>
        <p>
          We now have a long <strong>track record</strong> of successul projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          It isn’t just about developing software! Lots of people can write great code; Novelys offers more. When it comes to bridging the gap between an idea and a working project, we really know who to listen to - <strong>you</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
          We are experts in our domains, and recognized as such. We’re committed to <strong>technology</strong>. It’s a long term relationship and we’re smitten. It’s not simply a case of throwing every slice of new tech at a project. There’s a delicate <strong>balance</strong> between beneficial new technology and stable, old-faithful components. Each project is different.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are <strong>passionate</strong> about the web. We love its plasticity, its constant organic evolution. We are always up-to-date, constantly watching new stuff, experimenting, separating the wheat from the chaff.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're <strong>Agile</strong>. Our quality process includes different agile methologies such as <strong>XP</strong>, <strong>Scrum</strong> or <strong>Kanban</strong>. Transparency is at the core of our company culture: we share our culture, our tools, our knowledge and our passion with our customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work a lot with startups. That means that we have the competences and mindset to live in the startup world. And we can bring this spirit into <strong>your</strong> company.
        </p>
        <h1>What are the technologies we use?</h1>
        <p>
          We use <strong>rapid</strong> prototyping technologies to quickly transform your ideas into a live application. Technologies such as <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="http://www.novelys.com">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> or <a href="http://www.redis.io">Redis</a>, <a href="">Javascript</a> (with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> or <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>) are part of our standard toolbox. We then maintain these applications through the time. We work with some customers for years now!
